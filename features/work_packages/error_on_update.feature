Feature: Error messages are displayed

  Background:
    Given there is 1 user with:
      | login     | manager |
      | firstname | the     |
      | lastname  | manager |
    And the user "manager" has the following preferences
      | warn_on_leaving_unsaved | false |
    And there is 1 project with the following:
      | identifier | ecookbook |
      | name       | ecookbook |
    And there is a role "manager"
    And the role "manager" may have the following rights:
      | edit_work_packages |
      | view_work_packages |
    And I am working in project "ecookbook"
    And the user "manager" is a "manager"
    And there are the following work packages in project "ecookbook":
      | subject |
      | pe1     |
    And there is an activity "design"
    And I am already logged in as "manager"

  @javascript
  Scenario: Inserting a too long subject results in an error beeing shown
    When I go to the edit page of the work package called "pe1"
     And I click the edit work package button
     And I fill in the following:
       | Subject  | Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam,quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. mollit anim id est laborum. |
     And I submit the form by the "Save" button

    Then I should see an error notification stating "Subject is too long (maximum is 255 characters)"
